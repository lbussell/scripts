# Shell Cheatsheet

## General

- Figure out what shell is running: `echo $0`

## File/text manipulation

- Replace file contents:
    ```
    $ echo "foo" > bar.txt
    $ echo "foo" > bar.txt
    $ cat bar.txt
    foo
    ```
- Append file contents
    ```
    $ echo "foo" >> bar.txt
    $ echo "foo" >> bar.txt
    $ cat bar.txt
    foo
    foo
    ```
